# Hello there

This is a public clone of SyncEd repository without the Google API keys and other sensitive information. The repo was created for demonstration purposes to support my [portfolio](https://www.notion.so/and/SyncEd-ae85c9b76e714ae392b83f037a088cc5), and this project cannot be built in Xcode. If you need access to the original version of the project, [shoot me an email](mailto:andgordienco@gmail.com) and Iâ€™ll invite you to the private repo.
